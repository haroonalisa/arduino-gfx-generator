# Arduino OLED Graphics Generator

Create custom graphics and text for SSD1306 OLED displays using Adafruit GFX library

## Description

This web-based tool allows Arduino developers to easily design and generate code for graphics on SSD1306 OLED displays. Here is an online demo: https://arduinogfxtool.netlify.app/

Features include:

- Interactive canvas for visual design
- Support for pixels, lines, rectangles, circles, triangles, polygons, and text
- Real-time code generation for Arduino using the Adafruit GFX library
- Export functionality for seamless integration into your Arduino projects
- Compatible with SSD1306 OLED displays and Arduino boards
- User-friendly interface

Perfect for prototyping, education, and quick OLED display programming. No coding required - design visually and get Arduino-ready code.
